# protea-plants-machine-learning

A machine learning project using the Raspberry Pi and camera module along with OpenCV and TensorFlow Lite to detect two different Protea flowers - which are indigenous to South Africa. In this example, I've trained the machine learning model to detect two different types of Protea species, the High Gold and King Protea. The image data used to train the model was taken with a Samsung Note 20 Ultra. A total of about 60 images were used (30 for each species) to train the model.
